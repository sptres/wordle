# Wordle

Wordle is a simple word-guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. This web app version of Wordle allows you to play the game directly in your browser.

## Dataset

The words used in this game have been extracted from the top 1000 most frequently used words, sourced from [byjus.com](https://byjus.com).

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, a hidden word will be selected from the dataset. The length of the word will be indicated by empty tiles on the game board.
2. Use your keyboard to enter letters into the tiles. Press `Enter` to submit your guess for that row.
3. Correctly guessed letters that are in the right position will be highlighted in green.
4. Correct letters in the wrong position will be highlighted in yellow.
5. Incorrect letters will be highlighted in red.
